# Javasacript practices from Scrimba Course

**Web course**: [*Learn JavaSript*](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript) with Per Harald Borgen. This is just a way to remember some of the basic JavaScript I have learnt in the past years.

## *Practices*

Throughout the course, three apps were built on JavaScript. These are the apps:

+ *First practice* : The **Passenger counting app** is just a counter that also shows previous saved records.

+ *Second practice* : The **Blackjack game app** is a simple demo of the famous *Blackjack* cards game.

+ *Third practice* : This **Chrome extension app** lists all tabs and websites you have saved as a bookmark would do.
